### Image Features

<br/>

#### 1. ImageColorDistribution

Analyzes and presents the color intensity distribution across image datasets.

This feature assesses the distribution of color intensities in images and provides detailed visualizations for each
color channel. It is designed to highlight differences and consistencies in color usage between training and
validation datasets, which can be critical for adjusting image preprocessing parameters or for enhancing data augmentation techniques.

*[source code](https://github.com/Deci-AI/data-gradients/blob/master/src/data_gradients/feature_extractors/common/image_color_distribution.py)*

<br/>

#### 2. ImageDuplicates

Extracts image duplicates, in the directories train_image_dir, valid_image_dir (when present) and their intersection.

Under the hood, uses Difference Hashing (http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html)
 and considers duplicates if and only if they have the exact same hash code. This means that regardless of color format
  (i.e BGR, RGB greyscale) duplicates will be found, but might result (rarely) in false positives.

Attributes:
    train_image_dir: str, The directory containing all train images. When None, will ask the user using prompt for input.

    valid_image_dir: str. Ignored when val_data of the AbstractManager is None. The directory containing all
     valid images. When None, will ask the user using prompt for input.


    The following attributes are populated after calling self.aggreagate():

        self.train_dups: List[List[str]], a list of all image duplicate paths inside train_image_dir.

        self.valid_dups: List[List[str]], a list of all image duplicate paths inside valid_image_dir.

        self.intersection_dups: List[List[str]], a list of all image duplicate paths, that are duplicated in
         valid_image_dir and train_image_dir (i.e images that appear in train and validation).

        train_dups_appearences: int, total image count of duplicated images in train_image_dir.

        validation_dups_appearences, int, total image count of duplicated images in valid_image_dir.

        intersection_train_appearnces, int, total image count in train_image_dir that appear in valid_image_dir.

        intersection_val_appearnces int, total image count in valid_image_dir that appear in train_image_dir.


    Example:
        After running self.aggreagte() on COCO2017 detection dataset (train_image_dir="/data/coco/images/train2017/",
         valid_image_dir=/data/coco/images/val2017/):

        self.train_dups: [['/data/coco/images/train2017/000000216265.jpg', '/data/coco/images/train2017/000000411274.jpg']...]
        self.valid_dups: [] -> no duplicates in validation
        self.intersection_dups: [['/data/coco/images/train2017/000000080010.jpg', '/data/coco/images/val2017/000000140556.jpg'],
                                    ['/data/coco/images/train2017/000000535889.jpg', '/data/coco/images/val2017/000000465129.jpg']]

        self.train_dups_appearences: 72
        self.validation_dups_appearences: 0
        self.intersection_train_appearnces: 2
        self.intersection_val_appearnces: 2

        IMPORTANT: We get len(self_train_dups) = 35, but there are 72 appearences pf duplicated images in the train directory.
            This is because we have two triplet duplicates inside our train data.


NOTES:
     - DOES NOT TAKE IN ACCOUNT ANY DATASET INTERNAL LOGIC, SIMPLY EXTRACTS THE DUPLICATES FROM THESE DIRECTORIES.
     - If an image in the image directory can't be loaded, no duplicates are searched for the image.
     - Supported image formats: 'JPEG', 'PNG', 'BMP', 'MPO', 'PPM', 'TIFF', 'GIF', 'SVG', 'PGM', 'PBM', 'WEBP'.

in the dataset.
By visualizing this data, users can quickly assess whether certain classes or splits contain images that are consistently larger or smaller than others,
potentially indicating a need for data preprocessing or augmentation strategies to ensure model robustness.

Key Uses:

- Identifying classes with notably different average image sizes that may influence model training.
- Detecting splits in the dataset where image size distribution is uneven, prompting the need for more careful split strategies or
tailored data augmentation.
